### Motivation

Haven-AI a library that helps you easily turn your code base into an effective, large-scale machine learning benchmark. You will be able to launch thousands of experiments in parallel, visualize their results and status, and ensure that they are reliable, reproducible, and that the code base is modular to facilitate collaboration and easy integration of new models and datasets.

The goal of this library is help you quickly and efficiently find solutions to machine learning problems, get papers accepted, and win at competitions.

### Install

Master:
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/haven-ai/haven-ai
```

Dev:
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/haven-ai/haven-ai@dev
```

    
## **Getting Started**

- Run a minimal example with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iqmJWTfsC3Erfay_SwEoUhq_wS4l18Fd?usp=sharing">Google Colab</a>.

- Run experiments in sequence: 

```
python trainval.py --savedir_base ../results -r 1
```

- Run experiments in parallel using **slurm** tested under **Compute Canada** servers:

```
python trainval.py --savedir_base ../results -r 1 -j slurm
```

- Run experiments in parallel using **toolkit**:

```
python trainval.py --savedir_base ../results -r 1 -j toolkit
```

- Run experiments in parallel using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

```
To be added

## Motivation

- Haven is a library for building, managing and visualizing large-scale reproducible experiments. It helps developers establish a workflow that allows them to quickly prototype a reliable codebase. It also helps them easily  scale that codebase to one that can run, manage, and visualize thousands of experiments seamlessly. 

- The library provides a wide range of functionality including best practices for defining experiments, checkpointing, visualizing and debugging experiments, and ensuring reproducible benchmarks. 

- This library could strongly boost productivity for building great products, winning machine learning competitions, and getting research papers published. 

- The only structure required is that each experiment has the following.
    * `<savedir_base>/<exp_id>/exp_dict.json` that defines a single set of hyperparamters as a python `dict`.
    * `exp_id` is the hash of that hyperparameter python `dict`.
    * `<savedir_base>/<exp_id>/score_list.pkl` that has a list of dicts where each dict contains metrics as keys with scores as their values.
